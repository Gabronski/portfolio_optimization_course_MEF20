# portfolio_optimization_course_MEF20
This repository is an attempt to collect all the functions created in order to apply portfolio optimization problems, studied during the lessons of MEF course.
This is an initiative carried out by a student, it is unofficial. I am working also on a package for all these functions.

# Before the  download of the file, make sure that "main.R" and "bond_functions.R" are stored in the same working directory. 
before running the code use setwd("/yourbeautifulpath") in case you want work in the same directory.

I do not know if there are mistakes, in case write me on whatsapp.
